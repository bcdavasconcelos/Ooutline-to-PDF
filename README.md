# Ooutline to PDF

This template is for converting a text directly from OmniOutliner to PDF using Pandoc preserving internal row-level cross-references.  `OO/Rtf → Markdown → LaTeX → PDF`

Use the styles in the template to create headings, block-quotes, lists and so on. Italics, bold and links will be converted automatically. To references another row, you can simply use the row link.
